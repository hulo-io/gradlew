> This is an experimental project that aims to rewrite the original bash scripts in the [gradlew](https://github.com/gradle/gradle) source code using the [Hulo](https://github.com/hulo-lang) language.
> By transforming imperative shell scripts into declarative Hulo code, the project explores modern script practices and maintainability.
